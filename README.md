# User Story:
As someone new to GitHub, I want to understand how regular expressions (regex) can help me work with code, so I can efficiently find and modify specific parts of the codebase.

# Description:
Regex can do that by looking for patterns that match the structure of an email address,phone numbers etc. Once you find things, you can also replace them. So, if you want to change all the phone numbers in a document to a different format, regex can help with that too.
Regex can check if text follows a certain pattern.  Lets say i am building a application on a website and want to make sure the user enters valid email addresses, regex can help validate that the input matches the correct format.
It's also handy for pulling out specific bits of information from text. If I have a bunch of data that is un readble (like mine) and I only need certain parts of it, regex can help me pull what i am looking for specifically .
